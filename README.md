One of the most popular activities on the Web is shopping. It has much allure in it — you can shop at your leisure, anytime, and in your pajamas. Consumers can easily search through a large database of products and services. They can see actual prices, build an order over several days and email it as a "wish list" hoping that someone will pay for their selected goods. Customers can compare prices with a click of the mouse and buy the selected product at best prices. Online vendors, in their turn, also get distinct advantages.  

While ecommerce has an access to global markets fulfilling costumers’ fashion needs worldwide, there can be lack of security, reliability leading to increasing returns, reverse pickup cost, etc leading to huge loss. Wrong size and fit is the top reason for returning of merchandise bought online leading to increased added cost, clash of fashion and tech.
To tackle with this problem we have proposed a [solution](https://github.com/Arpita-25/Invincible-Myntra/tree/main/Round%201).
